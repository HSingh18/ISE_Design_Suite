Overview
	Car sensors are placed along the farmroad to raise a signal as long as a vehicle is waiting to cross the highway. 
	As long as no vehicle is detected on the farmroad, the lights should remain green in the highway direction. 
	If a vehicle is detected on the farmroad, the highway lights will change from yellow to red which allows the farmroad to change to green. 
	The farmroad lights stay green for ten seconds, and never longer than that set interval to allow the traffic to flow along the highway. 
	After a little while, the farmroad lights will change from green to yellow to red, allowing the highway lights to return to green. 
	A left turn sensor is also implemented into the experiment. 
	When a car triggers the left turn signal, the highway will go from green to yellow to red and farmroad will turn green. 
	After a little while farmroad will turn yellow then red and left will turn green.
	Then finally after some time left will go yellow then red and highway will go back to green. 
	Also, a pedestrian sensor is implemented in the design. 
	When a pedestrian triggers the pedestrian sensor, the highways light will go from green to yellow to red. The farmroad and pedestrian lights will both turn green at the same time
	The pedestrians sensor and the farm road light are activated at the same time.
